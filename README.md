# RL_JS_MatrixRain
Matrix Rain in Vanilla JS

- Tutorial done, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5ZswIE_SgY 
- Project is listening at: https://rl445.brighton.domains/RL_Matrix_Rain/index.html 

- There are some variations I would like to do in future, such as azbukah, hebrew language and other interesting symbols.. 
    alco colour is now set to gradient, this could be intresting to randomise a bit more.. but the fillStyle is set for the canvas, not for each symbol, this is possible to achieve
    (it is commented in the project)
